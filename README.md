# DabCoin

Proof-of-dab based cryptocurrency written in 7 hours. A collaboration with [Marcel O'Neil](https://github.com/marceloneil) and [Curtis Chong](https://github.com/curtischong). Marcel wrote the React based front end and web wallet, Curtis wrote the dab-or-not-dab classifier, and I wrote the cryptocurrency network nodes and the API for clients to interact with the network. Made for [TerribleHack XI](terriblehack.website).
